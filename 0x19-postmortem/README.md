Postmortem

My first postmortem

Issue Summary

Duration: A harrowing 180 minutes, from 09:00 PM to 00:00 AM GMT (West African Time).

Impact: Users of our beloved e-commerce website experienced slightly frustrating slow page load times and some unlucky shoppers were unable to complete purchases during the outage. Approximately 30% of users were affected - a tragedy by any measure.

Root Cause: The cause of the issue was simply an increase in traffic that overwhelmed our web application servers, causing slow response times and some requests to timeout. We learned that even the mightiest of servers can succumb to the whims of the online shopping gods.

Debugging Process
Bug debugger Brennan (BDB... as in my actual initials... made that up on the spot, pretty good, huh?) encountered the issue upon opening the project and being, well, instructed to address it, roughly 19:20 PST. He promptly proceeded to undergo solving the problem.

Checked running processes using ps aux. Two apache2 processes - root and www-data - were properly running.

Looked in the sites-available folder of the /etc/apache2/ directory. Determined that the web server was serving content located in /var/www/html/.

In one terminal, ran strace on the PID of the root Apache process. In another, curled the server. Expected great things... only to be disappointed. strace gave no useful information.

Repeated step 3, except on the PID of the www-data process. Kept expectations lower this time... but was rewarded! strace revealed an -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory) error occurring upon an attempt to access the file /var/www/html/wp-includes/class-wp-locale.phpp.

Looked through files in the /var/www/html/ directory one-by-one, using Vim pattern matching to try and locate the erroneous .phpp file extension. Located it in the wp-settings.php file. (Line 137, require_once( ABSPATH . WPINC . '/class-wp-locale.php' );).

Removed the trailing p from the line.

Tested another curl on the server. 200 A-ok!

Wrote a Puppet manifest to automate fixing of the error.

Summation
In short, a typo. Gotta love'em. In full, the WordPress app was encountering a critical error in wp-settings.php when trying to load the file class-wp-locale.phpp. The correct file name, located in the wp-content directory of the application folder, was class-wp-locale.php.

Patch involved a simple fix on the typo, removing the trailing p.

Prevention
This outage was not a web server error, but an application error. To prevent such outages moving forward, please keep the following in mind.

Test! Test test test. Test the application before deploying. This error would have arisen and could have been addressed earlier had the app been tested.

Status monitoring. Enable some uptime-monitoring service such as UptimeRobot to alert instantly upon outage of the website.

This will never occur again as such a mistake is noted for future purposes, because as programmers, we are not perfect, such mistakes happen sometimes!
